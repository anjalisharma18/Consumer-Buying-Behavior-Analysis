# Consumer-Buying-Behavior-Analysis
This project is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers which is based on unsupervised learning algorithms. It helps a business to better understand its customers based on their specific needs &amp; behaviors.
This analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
